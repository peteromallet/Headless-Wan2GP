# Recent Development Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major development work completed across 9 commits, focusing on system optimization, bug fixes, and infrastructure improvements.

## Major Features & Improvements

### Batch Processing System Refactoring
- **Removed batch optimization system** from the travel orchestrator to simplify the codebase
- Eliminated over 2,000 lines of complex batching logic including:
  - `batch_optimizer.py` (574 lines)
  - `travel_batch_handler.py` (648 lines)
  - Associated test files and documentation
- Simplified travel orchestrator to use individual segment processing only
- Maintains existing functionality without batching complexity

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### Phantom Task Prevention
- **Fixed major concurrency bug** in the update-task-status Edge Function
- **Root cause**: Tasks were being set to 'In Progress' without proper worker claiming fields (worker_id, claimed_at)
- **Impact**: Created phantom tasks that counted toward concurrency limits but couldn't be found by workers, blocking the entire task processing system
- **Solution**: Added validation requiring worker_id and claimed_at when setting status to 'In Progress'
- Returns descriptive 400 errors directing users to proper claiming functions
- Updated documentation to prevent future misuse

#### Filename Sanitization for Single Image Tasks
- **Fixed Supabase upload failures** for single_image tasks with special characters in prompts
- **Root cause**: User prompts containing characters like `§`, `®`, `©`, `™`, `@`, `,` caused WGP to generate invalid storage keys
- **Impact**: Generation succeeded but upload failed with "Invalid key" errors
- **Solution**: Added filename sanitization in PNG conversion pipeline using existing `sanitize_filename_for_storage()` function
- Enhanced character removal pattern to include comma and other problematic symbols
- Travel segments already worked due to existing sanitization in upload utilities

### Video Processing Enhancements
- **Automatic first frame extraction** for video uploads
- Enhanced complete-task edge function payload to include first frame thumbnails
- Videos automatically extract first frame during upload process
- Supports multiple video formats (.mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .webm, .m4v)
- First frame saved as `{filename}_frame_0.jpg` and encoded as base64
- Graceful fallback if frame extraction fails
- Universal system works for all task types (travel_stitch, single_image, etc.)

### LoRA System Consolidation
- **Implemented comprehensive LoRA processing consolidation** with `process_all_loras()` as single entry point
- **Auto-download functionality** for LightI2X and CausVid LoRAs
- Support for additional_loras dict format with URL downloads
- **Consolidated 200+ lines of duplicate LoRA logic** across files
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout pipeline
- Ensures proper multiplier/filename list synchronization
- Support for both HuggingFace and direct URL downloads

## Infrastructure & Setup Improvements

### CUDA Validation System
- Added `check_cuda.py` script to validate NVIDIA drivers, PyTorch CUDA, and VRAM
- Updated README.md with clear CUDA installation warnings for Windows users
- Emphasizes requirement for CUDA-enabled PyTorch vs CPU-only version
- Provides troubleshooting guidance for common Windows CUDA issues

### Dependency Management
- **Resolved dependency conflicts** in requirements.txt
- Updated peft version from 0.15.0 to >=0.17.0 to resolve diffusers compatibility
- Removed conflicting packages that duplicate Wan2GP dependencies
- Added minimum version requirement for supabase>=2.0.0
- Fixed variable name bug (lora_subdir -> lora_dir) in headless_model_management.py
- Improved installation reliability by eliminating pip dependency resolution conflicts

## Code Cleanup
- **Removed legacy backup files** and outdated code
- Deleted irrelevant test files and examples
- Cleaned up unused CUDA check scripts and parameter test files
- Removed outdated LoRA handling code not used by main system

## System Architecture Updates
- Updated STRUCTURE.md with LoRA system documentation
- Added comprehensive system architecture documentation
- Documented bug fixes and correct usage patterns
- Enhanced overall codebase documentation

## Technical Impact
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed over 2,000 lines of complex batching code
- **Enhanced reliability**: Fixed critical phantom task bug affecting system concurrency
- **Improved user experience**: Automatic video thumbnail generation
- **Better maintainability**: Consolidated LoRA processing logic
- **Stronger setup process**: CUDA validation and dependency conflict resolution
- **Cleaner architecture**: Removed legacy code and improved documentation

## Files Modified Summary
- **Major refactoring**: `travel_between_images.py`, `headless_model_management.py`
- **New utilities**: `check_cuda.py`, enhanced `lora_utils.py`
- **Bug fixes**: `update-task-status/index.ts`, `db_operations.py`
- **Documentation**: `STRUCTURE.md`, `README.md`, `HEADLESS_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt`, `Wan2GP/requirements.txt`
