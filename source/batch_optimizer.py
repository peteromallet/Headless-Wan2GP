"""
Batch Optimizer for Travel Segment Generation

This module implements intelligent batching of travel segments to improve efficiency
for multi-image journeys. Instead of generating each segment individually, it combines
nearby segments that fit within model constraints (≤81 frames) into single batch generations.

Key Benefits:
- Reduces model loading overhead (1x vs Nx)
- Better GPU utilization with longer sequences  
- Fewer I/O operations and intermediate files
- 2-3x speedup for short multi-image sequences

The system maintains full compatibility with existing stitching and maintains the same
final output quality while dramatically improving generation efficiency.
